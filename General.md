# General Overview of BeagleBoards
Before we dive into the world of [BeagleBoard](https://beagleboard.org/), we need to get a few jargon and basic concepts out of our way first!


Let's have a look at _when_ one should consider using the Beagle Boards. <br>
The Beagle boards are perfectly placed for the integration of high-level software and low-level electronics in any type of project. <br>
The major advantage over more traditional embedded systems, such as the Arduino, PIC, and AVR microcontrollers, is apparent when you leverage the Linux OS for your projects. For example, if you built a home automation system using the BeagleBone and you then decided that you wanted to make certain information available on the internet, you could simply install a web server.

Some keywords to remember:-
* **Preemption**: In computing, preemption is the act of temporary interruption of an executing task, with the intention of resuming that at a time later.

* **McASP** is an acronym for Multichannel Audio Serial Port, a communication peripheral found in Texas Instruments family of digital signal processors.  McASP functions as a general-purpose audio serial port.
