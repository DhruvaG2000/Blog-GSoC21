# Week4

## Logs from June 20 to June 27

- Debugged the new overlay, named [BBAI-AUDI-02-00A0.dts](https://github.com/beagleboard/BeagleBoard-DeviceTrees/blob/v4.19.x-ti-overlays/src/arm/overlays/BBAI-AUDI-02-00A0.dts) and got it working with the AI+Bela cape. It has been merged in the official BeagleBoard-DeviceTrees repo under overlays. This is where I complete all the objectives under my **Milestone 1** ie.
    1. [Introductory YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLXCrlQwXeI)
    2. Setting pinmux values appropriately and fix the dt overlay to get the correct clock.
    3. verifying that it works running with ALSA using the BBAI-AUDI-02-00A0.dts overlay.
