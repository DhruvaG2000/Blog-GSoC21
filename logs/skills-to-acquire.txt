# This file is a check-list of all the skills I need during this summer.

* Software (mostly in C/C++):
    - [X] STL (incl vectors, set, etc.)
    - [X] Preprocessor macros
    - [ ] assembling a asm program using gcc
    - [X] including __ASM__ directive in a program
    - [ ] RTOS in ESP-IDF

* Hardware:
    - [ ] KiCAD (by completing the RP2040-DEV-board)

* Things to do:
- SPI (change base address)
- GPIO (change base addresses and pin mappings)
- McASP->PRU IRQs. These were mapped abusing the rtdm_pruss_irq driver, but should probably be done via rproc now. This would allow to support the pru_rtaudio_irq.p code, which is used by other capes (CTAG etc)
- PRU->ARM IRQs. This is what the rtdm_pruss_irq was initially designed for. Ideally we'd just port the driver over, this may require looking in more detail at the interrupt controller. This would allow to remove the BELA_USE_POLL from make and reduce CPU consumption.
