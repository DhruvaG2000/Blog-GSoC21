#Pre-Selection

## Logs up-to May 18
- Started writing proposal for BeagleBoard Blynk app support, but did not proceed as the chances of it getting accepted seemed feeble.
- Started writing proposal on Robot control library support for BBAI. (However there wasn't a clear cut solution or workflow that I could offer, which is why it probably got rejected.)
- Made some minor contributions to the librobotcontrol git repo.
- Got in touch with giuliomoro, started looking up projects listed under audio applications. Selected Bela support for BBAI.
- Wrote proposal here: [bela_for_bbai](https://elinux.org/BeagleBoard/GSoC/2021_Proposal/bela_on_bbai)
- Started this thread on forum: [here](https://forum.beagleboard.org/t/bela-support-for-bbai-later-ti-chips/29257/7)
- got acquainted with BeagleBoard.org and Bela.io and what products and services they both offer.  
- My proposal for [Bela support for bbai](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/projects/#5697403266531328) gets accepted for GSoC 2021.
